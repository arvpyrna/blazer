# blazer - CLI tool for uploading/downloading files

- Control thread count
- File verification with SHA
- Rich meta data

# Todo:
- show time elapsed
- support for verbose logging
// storing data in current drive
// show progress
// use interactive terminal to show progress across each thread, so it more cooler
// upload it to free file sharing service upto some MB, you can build one for yourself and share
// it with others, write in go, or node js and also use it here, a simple service
// the life of the service can be just 1 hour, there you can learn so many interesting things
// download files after giving username and password(with authentication)
// export as package too, later somehow
// show current download speed and ETA

# Roadmap:
- Write a compatable, high speed server to compliment this client
- Support torrent based
- GUI maybe in electron or QTCreate
